### Sentiment Analysis on Customer Feedback using NLP

The "Sentiment Analysis on Customer Feedback using NLP" project leverages the power of Natural Language Processing (NLP) to evaluate and interpret customer reviews. By utilizing the VADER sentiment analyzer and TextBlob, the project assigns sentiment scores and measures subjectivity in the feedback. These scores are then categorized into various sentiment classes, including Highly Positive, Positive, Neutral, Negative, and Highly Negative. Built with Streamlit, the application provides a user-friendly interface that allows users to input text in real-time, analyze sentiments, and clean the text. Additionally, the project includes graphical representations of sentiment score distributions and showcases a sample of the processed data, giving users a comprehensive understanding of customer sentiments.

### Analyzing WhatsApp Data using Advanced Excel and Power BI

The project focused on analyzing WhatsApp data using advanced Excel and Power BI involved several key steps. Initially, large datasets were imported and cleaned to ensure accuracy and usability. Following this, comprehensive data analysis was performed to uncover patterns and insights within the data. Interactive dashboards and visualizations were created using Power BI, effectively communicating the findings to users. This project demonstrated proficiency in handling real-world data, utilizing advanced analytical tools, and drawing meaningful conclusions from complex datasets, showcasing the potential of these tools in data analysis.

### Diabetes Prediction and Analysis

The "Diabetes Prediction and Analysis" project aims to explore the relationships between various health indicators and diabetes status through data visualization, logistic regression, and statistical analysis. Key components of this project include:

1. **Data Visualization:** Visualizing relationships between health factors such as smoking, alcohol consumption, and diabetes status.
2. **Logistic Regression Model:** Building a logistic regression model to predict the likelihood of diabetes based on various health indicators.
3. **ANOVA Analysis:** Performing ANOVA (Analysis of Variance) to identify significant differences in health indicators between diabetic and non-diabetic individuals.

The project aims to identify key predictors of diabetes, develop predictive models, and validate these relationships statistically, providing valuable insights for healthcare professionals and researchers. 

### Book Recommendation System

The Book Recommendation System project involves implementing a collaborative filtering algorithm to generate personalized book recommendations. The key steps in this project include:

1. **Loading and Preprocessing Data:** Preparing the book data for analysis.
2. **Training a Matrix Factorization Model:** Using algorithms such as Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to learn user and item latent factors.
3. **Predicting Ratings and Recommending Books:** Using the trained model to predict ratings and recommend top books to users.

This project demonstrates how machine learning can be applied to create a functional book recommendation system that learns from user preferences and reading history, offering personalized book suggestions.
